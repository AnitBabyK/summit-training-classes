  * Register **data service** with CF runtime (`cf marketplace`)
  * **Provision** service - *optional* (`cf create-service`)
  * Provide connection **credentials** (`cf bind-service`)

  Some services have Service Brokers, APIs that enable them to advertise services in the Cloud Foundry marketplace.

  Developers can use them to provision services, like database instances, and then bind them to their apps.
