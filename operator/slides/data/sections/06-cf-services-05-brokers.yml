  * Register **data service** with Cloud Foundry (`cf marketplace`)
  * **Provision** service (`cf create-service`)
  * Provide connection **credentials** (`cf bind-service`)

notes: |

  Some services have Service Brokers, APIs that enable them to advertise services in the Cloud Foundry marketplace.

  You can deploy a BOSH release like MySQL yourself, and then register that as a Cloud Foundry service - or you can register services provided by third parties.

  Developers can use them to provision services, like database instances, and then bind them to their apps. `cf bind-service`
