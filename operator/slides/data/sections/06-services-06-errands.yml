  How do I get a **service broker** registered?

  ... with a **bosh errand**

  * **Instances**: Long running (vms running software)
  * **Errands**: Run once (tasks)


notes: |

  Instances (formly "jobs" in Bosh 1.0) are vms with installed software that are kept alive.  Errands are one off tasks.  Many releases encapsulate setup scripts in an errand, like registering a Service Broker
