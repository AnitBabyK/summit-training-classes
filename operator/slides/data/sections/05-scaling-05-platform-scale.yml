  Should I scale out or up?

  * First, **right size** VMs
  * Then, **scale out** (add instances)

notes: |

  Both with apps in CF and with the CF platform itself, it's best practice is to right size VMs in the installation. Then to add capacity, scale out.

  With CF, changing the number of running instances of an app incurs zero downtime, whereas scaling up vertically stops *all* instances and then recreates them.

  With BOSH, scaling vertically results in no downtime if there are multiple instances of whatever VM it is that you're scaling, but *does* cause downtime if there's only one instance.
