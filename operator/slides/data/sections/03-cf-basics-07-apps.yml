  **Applications**

  * Scoped to a space
  * Accessible via 0 or more routes
  * Runtime dependencies provided by buildpacks


notes: |

  Applications are pushed to a space and can serve traffic via routes.  The dependencies needed to run an application are typically provided by a buildpack (unless a docker container is pushed).  Buildpacks provide consistency and control that Docker does not.
