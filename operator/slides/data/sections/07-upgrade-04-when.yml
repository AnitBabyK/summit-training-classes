    **When** should we upgrade?

  </span>

columnRightContent: |

  * Regularly - generally cannot "skip" versions

  * New CF stemcell, buildpack, and component versions ~ every week.

  * You should be upgrading during working hours!

notes: |

  Releases happen often as CF is advancing quickly.  BOSH makes upgrades easy and reliable and therefore updates should happen often and during normal business hours.  Example: Pivotal web services runs thousands of applications and is updated multiple times a week.
