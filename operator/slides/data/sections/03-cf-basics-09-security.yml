  Egress networking for applications

notes: |

  CF is a shared compute cluster, which makes egress networking hard.

  ASGs are configured as iptables in the host by Garden. They are bound to either app running or stagin phases.

  Inbound access is not part of the platform currently and is left to the load balancer or application.
