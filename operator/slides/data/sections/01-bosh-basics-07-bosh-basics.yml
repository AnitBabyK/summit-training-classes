  * **BOSH CPI** - Cloud Provider Interface
    * `create_vm`, `attach_disk`, `delete_vm` ...
    * for: vSphere | Openstack | AWS | Azure | GCE | Garden

  * 1 x BOSH **director**, n x VMs running BOSH agents

notes:

  BOSH separates the concerns of clusters from underlying infrastructure via a Cloud Provider Interface.  The CPI defines common functions and CPIs exist for many infrastructures.

  The BOSH Director is the "brains" of the operation and what you will be interacting with.
