    * **Log Drains**: Send logs to external syslog-compliant service (ex. ELK, papertrail)

    * **Nozzles**: The programs that enable you to do this, and which filter/manipulate data

notes: |

  Cloud Foundry makes integration with purpose-built tools easy. Doppler VMs receive logs from all other components, where they're stored in buffers and sent to either the Traffic Controller or a third-party syslog drain.

  The Traffic Controller exposes the Firehose.

  Nozzles are programs that consume the Firehose and, after transforming the data, forward it to other services. e.g. The Datadog nozzle, the Syslog nozzle.
