  * **Applications**:  All app instance logs and relevant component logs
  * **Firehose**: All logs from all apps and components plus metrics
  * **Nozzles**: Consume from the firehose (select, buffer, transform, forward)

notes: |

  App developers can tail logs from all app instances and relevant components (like the router).  Operators can tap into the firehose which contains all logs from all apps and components as well as metrics.  Nozzles can be attached to filter, transform, forward, etc.
