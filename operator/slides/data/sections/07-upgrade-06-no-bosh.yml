columnRightContent: |

  * How many VMs?
  * How many applications?
  * What happens when a CVE occurs in one component?

  * **How could BOSH help you?**

notes: |

  What happens when a CVE occurs in the O/S? How about in the application runtime? How hard are these to address without BOSH?

  With BOSH these events are easy to address. New O/S updates can even be picked up and deployed by CI with zero downtime automatically.
