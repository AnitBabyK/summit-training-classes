    * **Canaries**: # of failures that will trigger a roll back
    * **Max in Flight**: Concurrent upgrades
    * max_in_flight **must be less than** # of instances!

notes: |

  BOSH is optimized for day 2 onward.  Updates are performed with zero downtime (if configured correctly) by taking instances out of service, creating new ones and placing them in service.  VMs are immutable and never patched.
