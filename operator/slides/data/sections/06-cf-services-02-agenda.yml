  We'll be talking about Cloud Foundry services, the Service Broker APIs through which they interact with the platform, and the binding of those services to apps.

  We'll also briefly look at the process of making services available in the Cloud Foundry marketplace, which we do using BOSH errands - a type of one-off task.
