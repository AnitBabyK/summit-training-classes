  * Cloud Controller - REST API
  * Diego Brain - allocates the workload
  * Diego Cell(s) - run the apps

  This is the structure of a Cloud Foundry deployment. By now, you should know how to see all of the VMs that make up a CF deployment using BOSH (our example has 15, but typically there will be several dozen VMs).
  We are not going to cover all of the components, but some of the important ones are

    * Cloud Controller. A REST API used by developers, admins, etc to access the system, and maintains a database of orgs, spaces, services, user roles (we'll see more of these in a moment)

    * Diego Brain. Coordinates the running of apps, by holding auctions among Diego Cell VMs in order to find the best place to run an app instance.

    * Diego Cell. Runs apps inside containers.
