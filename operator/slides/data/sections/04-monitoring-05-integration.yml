    * **Log Drains**: Send logs to external syslog compliant service (ex. ELK, papertrail)
    * **Nozzles**: Events and metrics to external tools (ex. datadog)
    * **CF Plugin**: Access the firehose from the CLI

  Cloud Foundry makes integration with purpose built tools simple and easy.  CF supports standards rather than locking you in to a specific solution.
