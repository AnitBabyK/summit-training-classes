  **Spaces**: Used to divide organizations (commonly as "development", "staging", etc)

  * Fully Qualified Domain Names (`myapp.example.com`)
  * Security Groups (outbound app traffic)
  * Services
  * Apps

notes: |

  Spaces are typically used to seperate environments for a tenant or project. However, there are no limits and users are free to implement any structure they see fit.  Applications are always pushed to spaces.
