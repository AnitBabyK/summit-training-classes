  What is the relationship between **orgs**, **spaces** & **apps**?

  ```nohighlight

                . Org                   . cf-hero
                |                       |
                \-- Space               \-- training
                   |                       |
                   |-- App 1               |-- web-app
                   \-- App 2               \-- worker-app
  .
  ```
  Run `cf target` to confirm your org and current space.

  ```sh
  $ cf target
