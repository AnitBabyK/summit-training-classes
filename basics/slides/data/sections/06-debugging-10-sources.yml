notes: |

  * Loggregator aggregates logs from all instances and relevant components.  If you suspected a routing problem in your existing org, how would you get the logs?  What if you have 100 instances running?
  * Events shows things like start, stop, crash, etc.
  * Instrumentation hooks are built into the platform and support a multitude of 3rd party tools.
  * If you need to see things inside the container, you can SSH inside.
