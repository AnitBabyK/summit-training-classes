  **Where can you get Open Source Cloud Foundry?**

  * [github.com/cloudfoundry](https://github.com/cloudfoundry)
  * **cf-release** requires [BOSH](https://bosh.io/docs) knowledge
  * **BOSH-lite** for a local CF deployment

notes: |

  Cloud Foundry is an open source project.  Using the OSS distribution requires BOSH (significant learning curve).
