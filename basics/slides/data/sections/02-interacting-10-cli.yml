  How do I **interact** with CF?

  * **Command Line Interface** (CLI): from terminal / command prompt

  * **IDE plugins**

  * Vendor specific **web user interfaces**

  * CI tool integration (e.g Concourse.ci)

notes: |

  The CF CLI utility communicates with the Cloud Controller, a CF component, that exposes a RESTful API
