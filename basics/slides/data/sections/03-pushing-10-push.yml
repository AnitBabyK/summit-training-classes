  What happens when I `cf push`?

  1. **Upload**: App files sent to CF
  1. **Staging**: Executable artifact is created (droplet)
  1. **Running**: App starts on an app host

  App receives web requests (if it binds to TCP port)

notes: |

  CF CLI sent all our app files to the Cloud Controller.
  The Cloud Controller stores all files it receives in the Blob Store.
  It also stores metadata about the app in the database.
