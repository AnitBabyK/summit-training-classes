In this lab, we will use purposefully crash app instances and see how Cloud Foundry works to maintain availability.

## Pushing a Crashable App

_What happens when an app crashes?_

* Change to the `05-resilience/imperfect-app` directory and push the crashable app.
* Note the random URL for your app, and visit it in a browser.
* Click the 'crash' link
* Use `cf app imperfect-app` to see the state of your app.

Can you see it in the "crashed" state before Cloud Foundry restarts it?

## Access Your App Amid Failures

* Scale your app to 3 instances.

#### Checking Your Work

* Use `cf apps` to ensure you have 3 instances requested.
* Visit your app and click the 'crash' link.
* Refresh the page, and Cloud Foundry will send your request to one of the healthy instances.

### Can you crash instances quicker than Cloud Foundry can restart them?

If you have `watch` available on your system, use it to watch app instances restart.

```sh
$ watch cf apps # Watch app instances restart
```

If not, you can re-run `cf app` multiple times.

```sh
$ cf app imperfect-app

     state     since       cpu    memory         disk
#0   running   2015-11-02  0.0%   25.3M of 32M   66.9M of 128M
#1   down      2015-11-02  0.0%   0 of 0         0 of 0
#2   down      2015-11-02  0.0%   0 of 0         0 of 0
```

* _What happens if you make a request whilst they are all down?_
