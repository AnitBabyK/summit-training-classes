title: Stateful Services

In this lab,  you will create an instance of a Redis service and use it with an app.

## Creating a Service Instance

First, you need to create an instance of the service.

* Use `cf marketplace` to view the details of the Redis service
* Use the CLI to create an instance of the `30mb` plan

#### Checking Your Work

You can view your service instances:

```sh
$ cf services

name    service      plan   bound apps   last operation
redis   rediscloud   30mb                create succeeded
```

## Binding Service Instances

You need to bind your service instance to your application so it can be used.

* Push `07-shared-state/stateful-app` with the `--no-start` flag
* Use `cf bind-service` to bind your service instance to your app
* Start your app so that it can pick up the environment variables

#### Checking Your Work

You can view the details of your services, and see which apps your service is bound to:

```sh
cf services
```

If you hit the `/env` endpoint of your app, or run the command `cf env stateful-app`, you will see the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable that Cloud Foundry provides to your app. When a service is bound to your app, the service's details appear in this variable.

## Demonstrating Persistence

By storing state in a service we can restart apps without losing any data.

* Visit the app in a browser
* Observe the number of requests this app instance has served, along with the overall total number of requests _all_ app instances have served
* Restart the app and visit it in a browser again
* Observe that the total number of requests is still stored in Redis, even though the app was restarted

## Exploring the Service Instance Lifecycle

Service instances can be shared by many apps, and can live longer than the apps that use them.

* Increase the number of instances of your app
* Visit your app to see the difference between different app instances serving requests and the overall hit count in their shared Redis service instance

Now we have many app instances Cloud Foundry is load-balancing between them, but they're all sharing the same Redis instance.

* _What will happen when we unbind the app?_
* Stop the app, and use `cf unbind-service` to unbind the service from the app
* Rebind the app, and start it
* Observe that the Redis instance still holds the same state

Unbinding did not delete data in Redis. It _did_ remove the credentials that our app was using to connect to Redis, but new ones were issued when we bound the app again.

* _What will happen when we delete the service instance?_
* _Can you use `cf delete-service redis`?_
* Do whatever is necessary to delete the service instance, and then create it again
* When you start your app and visit it in a browser, you'll see that this is a new, clean Redis instance with no existing state

  * Learn about [security groups](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/adminguide/app-sec-groups.html)
  * Use a [manually created](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/services/user-provided.html) IBM [Cloudant instance](https://cloudant.com/)
